Got the server running at 9:57
It displayed:  this is the equivalent of @app.route('/')!



Which seems to come from views.py inside of apps folder in the project:
    from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse
    def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("this is the equivalent of @app.route('/')!")
